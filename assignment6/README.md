# Assignment 6

This is the project for [Assignment 6 of DSA](https://olindsa2024.github.io/assignments/assignment_06).

## Overview

This assignment is a chance to do an individual deep dive on an application or algorithm related to the themes of this 
class.

My project explores the traveling salesman problem and different ways to solve it or approximate a solution. I analyze 
the theoretical performance of different solutions and I also empirically measure their performance and compare these 
solutions in terms of the length of the paths and how long they took to find a solution.
