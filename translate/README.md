## Answers for Hello Kotlin

**What features do you like about Kotlin?**

I like that it is statically and strictly typed but has type inferences and a lot less fluff than Java. It feels a lot
like using Pylance right now. I also like the null safety features because they are so concise.

**Are there things you were expecting to find that you haven’t?**

Not really, I think that the intro covered the basics. The only thing I feel got glossed over a little was importing
external code, but from the few examples in the tutorial it seems easy enough. I’m curious about the package manager for
Kotlin though.

**What questions do you have?**

The main thing is using external code and general code organization best practices.
