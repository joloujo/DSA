## Writeup

I implemented Lempel-Ziv compression. The algorithm was able to compress "The Raven" by Edgar Allan Poe from 16560 bits 
to 12146 bits and *Romeo and Juliet* by William Shakespeare from 1139616 to 635721 bits. This is fairly significant, at 
27% space savings for "The Raven" and an impressive 44% space savings for *Romeo and Juliet*.

I wanted to see if converting the string to a bit array would make the compression more or less efficient. It turns out 
that using the strings directly is significantly more efficient in both space and time. Converting to binary actually 
made the encoding of "The Raven" take more space than the original text. In retrospect, this makes sense, because when
you encode with chars, you get more bang for your buck when you get a repetition since they are a byte instead of a bit.

| Text               | Raw     | LZ     | Bits â†’ LZ |
|--------------------|---------|--------|-----------|
| "The Raven"        | 16560   | 12146  | 17693     |
| *Romeo and Juliet* | 1139616 | 635721 | 918442    |
